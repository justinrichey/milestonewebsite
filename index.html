<h4>Title</h4>

<p>Wind force on grass simulation</p>

<h4>Team Members</h4>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>In this project, we will simulate the effects of wind on grass. We will start by building the data structures and bezier curves to model the grass and have constraints on its movement (twisting, bending, swinging). Then, we will implement the wind through fluid dynamics and integration in order to simulate the effects on grass (and cloth) over time.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Problem Description</h3>

<p>We will attempt to solve the problem of simulating the effects of wind on blades of grass. We ultimately hope to render grass that bends, swings, and twists in response to a wind source. Attempting to accurately model wind and grass is important in making outdoor scenes feel alive and realistic, rather than static.
  <br>
  <br>
There are two main components to our solution: we must model the grass and simulate the wind. This is challenging for a few reasons. Firstly, it is not trivial to simulate wind as it involves fluid dynamics and integration. Secondly, there are many forces that affect the grass. In addition to an external wind force, there are internal and damping forces. Thirdly, as mentioned above, the grass responds in more than one way to these forces (twisting, bending, and swinging). We plan to implement our solution by building upon a skeleton similar to the project 4 starter code. Weâ€™ll work through the shader pipeline and build vertex, tessellation, and geometry shaders for the grass. The shape of the blade will be defined by a bezier curve in the vertex shader, line segments will estimate the curve in the tessellation shader, and the geometry shader will fill out the shape of the grass based on those segments. The wind simulation will be based on the Navier-Stokes equation, and the force generated by the wind will be added to the external forces at each point that the grass consists of.

  <h4>Images & Demos</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>What we plan to achieve
      <ul>
        <li>Image of grass models
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scenes showing flexibility of grass blades without wind, so that it may then be affected by wind as shown in later scenes
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Video of a patch of grass twisting, bending, and swinging in response to wind force</li>
        <li>Scene of cloth responding to wind force (can render before building grass structure as a way to test correctness of wind simulation)</li>
        <li>Image of scenes with varying amounts of grass responding to wind (1 blade, a bush, a meadow, etc.)</li>
        <li>Render scenes with varying intensities of wind force, compare the effects on the grass</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What we hope to achieve
      <ul>
        <li>Interactive GUI with sliders for wind intensity and angle</li>
        <li>Stationary swaying grass</li>
        <li>Full scene of grass moving according to wind
          <ul>
            <li>For examaple, an entire environmental scene of grassy hills</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How we will measure the quality / performance of our system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy)</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>We will measure and compare the framerate and CPU/memory usage between scenes with varying amounts of grass</li>
      <li>We will take the aforementioned metrics before and after applying wind force to determine computational impact of the grass movement calculations</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>What questions we plan to answer with our analysis</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        How expensive will it be to render an entire scene of grass (hills, forests, etc.)? What are the ways we can optimize our render times, framerates and CPU/memory usage for this?
      </li>
      <li>How different is a cloth reacting to wind on it versus grass reacting to wind?</li>
      <li>How does varying the accuracy of the bezier curve estimate in the tessellation shader affect performance?</li>
    </ul>
